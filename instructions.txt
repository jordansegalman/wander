1. If you are unable to get the newest verison of the server working with
OpenSSL, a previous commit is needed to run this code. The following commit
should work: 181da74fd392f6b37570d2180cd3dba57093b945. 
2. In the index.js file on the server side, it is necessary to change 
response.send() methods to send JSON responses instead of string responses. 
	E.g. "return response.send(JSON.stringify({"response":"success"})).
3. Once we get an actual server, all of these issues will be resolved and
code will be updated.
4. The Android application should allow the creating and logging in to an
account given the NodeJS server and MySQL database are both up and running.
